# Laravel drill

**With this project, I have been practicing on the use of filters, along with that of Livewire components. 

*There are different filters, each working on its own, and they can be combined with each other.

*There is a reset filter button that comes in handy since datepickers don't provide a reset date feature.

*Livewire components allow to easily render dinamically the page without having to refresh the page without having to fiddle with Ajax requests and JavaScript; in fact I had to use only a few scripts, one for dismissing notifications and the other to import a script to copy some text to clipboard.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
